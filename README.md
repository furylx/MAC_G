# MAC_G

simple mac address changer with standard user input. Will add options to use as cli command in the future

What I m working on for the cli:

- learning more about mac addresses :)
- giving the choice to the user to get a random generated mac (LAA unicast)
- using the ip command instead of ifconfig (ip can return results in json...)
- letting the user choose from uaa, laa, uni- and multicast(with implementation of multicast with 01-00-5E, and without. Up to the user)
- inputting their own mac
- setting the mac to broadcast
- reverting the mac (still not sure if I should leave automatic backup or change it so one has to manually back up)
- show interfaces with mac and display the mac
- (maybe some day, set mac to specific vendor)
